        <h3>How do you take care of yourself?</h3>
        <p> We encourage you to try meditation and incorporate mindfulness to your routine; it will make you appreciate
            the little details around you and counteract your obsession with speed.</p>
        <p>Life can sometimes feel overwhelming. When bombarded with notifications, requests and information, it’s often
            difficult to silence our mind.</p>
        <p>Your inner attitude is what determines your happiness. Meditation makes you more aware and can only improve
            your life.</p>

        <h3>Learn how to Meditate</h3>
        <p> In Western culture, since childhood you learn a lot about geography, physics, history, math, biology,
            chemistry and more.
            <p> Only at the same time as the outer world is widely taught to us, we learn nothing about the inner world.
            </p>
            Did they teach you how to look inside yourself? Did they teach you how to be quiet and examine yourself?
            Did
            you teach you how to meditate step by step?</p>
        <p>Anyway, did they teach you anything about silence or meditation?</p>
        <p>To me? Never.</p>
        <p>We remain strangers to ourselves, we don't understand each other, and we try to understand each other by
            trying to understand others. Complicated, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Formal education teaches us little about the mind. Your unconscious world, where all your experiences
            are
            kept, which has a great influence on your life, remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>Meditation practices allow you to begin to develop greater control over your own mind.</p>

        <p>I confess that I went through some stages before I started meditating.</p>

        <p>At first, I thought meditation was silly, just for Tibetan mystics. But then I understood that meditation
            has a
            scientific basis.</p>
        <p>Then, even understanding all the benefits, I procrastinated for many years to start meditating. Why?
            Maybe
            out of fear, laziness, immaturity.</p>
        <p>But one day I made the decision and began to meditate. And since that moment I never stopped.</p>
        <p>And now, it seems like you also made the decision to start meditating, right? What good news! I help you
            learn to meditate.</p>
        <p>In fact, in childhood you were a great meditator. Your mind was clear, you were much more perceptive and
            much less judgmental, you lived much more present in each moment.</p>
        <p>But as you grew older, the turbulent mind came to dominate you. So it is necessary to relearn how to
            return
            to your old and natural state.</p>
        <p>You have been living under this whirlwind of thought for so long that you really believe that life is
            like
            that. It is not. Meditation is the way for you to rediscover and find yourself.</p>
        <p>And how can you start?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a quiet place;</li>
            <li>Sit in a comfortable position for you;</li>
            <li>Close your eyes;</li>
            <li>Keep your spine erect and breathe normally through your nose.</li>
            <li>Count each exhalation until you reach 10, then start counting again;</li>
            <li>When you get distracted, quickly return the count.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>It's simpler than you thought, isn't it?</p>
        <p>What will really make you reap the benefits of meditation: consistency.</p>
        <p>Perhaps you are now thinking that meditation is boring, repetitive, meaningless, and too simple. Did you
            expect anything more complex and were disappointed?</p>
        <p>Meditation is not complex. It is simple, very simple.
            Many experienced meditators find it difficult to meditate every day. But do you know why they still
            meditate?</p>
        <p>Because they understood the great physical, mental, and spiritual benefits that the constancy of
            meditation generates in those who practice.</p>
        <p>You will only discover what the rewarding experience of meditation really represents after a few weeks of
            daily practice.
            And you don't have to meditate for 30 minutes every day. Start with 5, 10 minutes a day and gradually
            increase the time.</p>

        <h3>Good luck!</h3>
