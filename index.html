        <h3>How do you take care of yourself?</h3>
        <p>When someone visits you at home, i bet you clean the place up, get everything organised and shop lots of
            delicious snacks.
            When a friend that lives in different city visits, you would take him/her to go sightseeing and find cool
            places to show.</p>
        <p>You give advice, support, speak words of love and tell them to take it easy on themselves.
            But why most of us don't treat ourselves as the most important person in the world?
            <p>Pat yourself on the back!
                Take stock of what you've accomplished on the job once a week or so—and congratulate yourself for your
                efforts and anything you've done to boost the bottom line or improve performance. Reminding yourself of
                your
                contributions gives you a psychological boost and helps you feel more positive, which is the ultimate
                goal
                of self care.</p>

            <h3>Remember to EXIST in your life</h3>

            <p>Look at your schedule, your daily to-do list. Do you appear in it?
                If your answer is NO, that's fine. Now you can change that by making small new choices.
                Take, for example, 10 minutes to be with you, whether listening to music, dancing at home, reading a
                book, taking a shower without interruption.</p>

            <p>We spend most of our time doing things for others and putting out fires.
                We live because of the traffic, that project, that report, that meeting, to pick up and take our
                children somewhere, to do this and that for someone else, and as if by magic, we disappeared from our
                lives!</p>
            <p>Take care of your home, your clothes, your
                body, your emotions and everything that surrounds you.
                It is when you treat yourself well that the universe understands that it should treat you well. It is
                when you take it easy on you that life
                takes it too.
                <h3>It all starts here</h3>
                <p>I encourage you to try meditation and incorporate mindfulness to your routine; it will make you
                    appreciate the little details around you and counteract the obsession we all have with speed.</p>
                <p>Life can sometimes feel overwhelming. When bombarded with notifications, requests and information,
                    it’s
                    often difficult to silence our mind.</p>
                <p>Research shows that mindfulness or "emptying the mind" every day for a few minutes helps improve
                    focus
                    and
                    productivity. When combined with meditation the benefits are even greater: improved sleep quality,
                    reduced
                    anxiety and stress. Forget about the idea that you can only meditate for long hours or in a temple.
                </p>

    <!--- Learn how to Meditate -->
    <a id="learn"></a>
    <section class="textArea container-fluid">
        <h3>Learn how to Meditate</h3>
        <p> In Western culture, as children we learn a lot about geography, physics, history, math, biology,
            chemistry... But at the same time as the outer world is widely taught to us, we learn nothing about the
            inner world.</p>
        <p>Did anyone teach you how to look inside yourself? Or anything about silence or meditation?</p>
        <p>We remain strangers to ourselves, we don't understand each other and we try to understand each other by
            trying to understand others. Complicated, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Formal education teaches us little about the mind. Your unconscious world, where all your experiences
            are kept, which has a great influence on your life, remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>In fact, during your childhood you were a great meditator. Your mind was clear, you were much more perceptive
            and much less judgmental, you were present in each moment. But as we grow older it is necessary to relearn
            how to
            return to our old and natural state.</p>
        <p>You have been living under this whirlwind of thought for so long that you really believe that life is
            like that. It is not. Now you will rediscover yourself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a quiet place;</li>
            <li>Sit in a comfortable position;</li>
            <li>Close your eyes;</li>
            <li>Relax the shoulders;</li>
            <li>Keep your spine erect and breathe normally through your nose;</li>
            <li>Count each exhalation until you reach 10, then start counting again;</li>
            <li>When you get distracted, quickly return the count.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's simpler than you thought, isn't it?</p>
        <p>What will really make you reap the benefits of meditation: consistency.
            You will discover what the rewarding experience of meditation really represents after a few weeks of
            daily practice and you don't have to meditate for 30 minutes every day. Start with 5, 10 minutes a day and
            gradually increase the time.</p>
        <h3>Remember to breathe</h3>
        <p>When we are going too fast - in body and in thought, this generates tension in the muscles and has negative
            impacts on the brain and heart as it impairs our circulation.
            As we remember to do some deep breathing cycles (inhale and exhale deeply and slowly), we oxygenate our
            brain, slow down our heartbeat and return to the present moment, which is where it all happens.
            It is in the present that we create the future based on our thoughts, feelings, emotions and vibration. We
            are like a radio that tunes to certain frequencies.</p>
        <h3>Where have you been tuning in?</h3>
        <h3>And where or what would you like to tune in now?</h3>
