        <h3>How do you take care of yourself?</h3>
        <p>Before a friend shows up you at our house, we usually make sure everything is tidy and stock up on
            delicious snacks.
            When someone from out of town visits, we take him/her to go sightseeing and discover cool
                places.</p>
            <p>We give advice, support and tell people to take it easy on themselves but most of us live because of the traffic, that project, that report, that meeting, to pick up and take our
                children somewhere and as if by magic, we slowly disappeared from our
                lives.</p>
            <h3>Remember to EXIST in your life</h3>
            <p>Look at your schedule, your daily to-do list. Do you appear in it?</p>
            <p>If your answer is NO, that's fine. Now you can change that by making a small new choice.
                Take, for example, 10 minutes to be with you, whether listening to music, dancing at home, reading a
                book, taking a shower without interruption.</p>
            <p>Take care of your emotions and everything that surrounds you.
                It is when you treat yourself well that the universe understands that it should treat you well. It is
                when you take it easy on you that life
                takes it too.
                <h3>It all starts here, because just this once, everyone else can wait</h3>
                <p>I encourage you to try meditation and incorporate mindfulness to your routine; it will make you
                    appreciate the little details around you and counteract the obsession we all have with speed.</p>
                <p>Life can sometimes feel overwhelming. When bombarded with notifications, requests and information,
                    it’s often difficult to silence our mind.</p>
                <p>Research shows that mindfulness or "emptying the mind" every day for a few minutes helps improve
                    focus and productivity. When combined with meditation the benefits are even greater: improved sleep
                    quality, reduced anxiety and stress. Forget about the idea that you can only meditate for long hours
                    or in a
                    temple.
                </p>

    <!--- Learn how to Meditate -->
    <a id="learn"></a>
    <section class="textArea container-fluid">
        <h3>Learn how to Meditate</h3>
        <p> In Western culture, as children we learn a lot about geography, physics, history, math, biology,
            chemistry... But at the same time as the outer world is widely taught to us, we learn nothing about the
            inner world.</p>
        <p>Did anyone teach you how to look inside yourself? Or anything about silence or meditation?</p>
        <p>We remain strangers to ourselves, we don't understand each other and we try to understand each other by
            trying to understand others. Complicated, isn't it?</p>
        <p>Formal education teaches us little about the mind. Your unconscious world, where all your experiences
            are kept, which has a great influence on your life, remains a mystery.</p>
        <p>In fact, during your childhood you were a great meditator. Your mind was clear, you were much more perceptive
            and much less judgmental, you were present in each moment. But as we grow older it is necessary to relearn
            how to
            return to our old and natural state.</p>
        <p>You have been living under this whirlwind of thought for so long that you really believe that life is
            like that. It is not.</p>
            <h3> Now you will rediscover yourself
            </p>Let's begin?</p></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a quiet place;</li>
            <li>Sit in a comfortable position;</li>
            <li>Close your eyes;</li>
            <li>Relax your shoulders;</li>
            <li>Keep your spine erect and breathe normally through your nose;</li>
            <li>Count each exhalation until you reach 10, then start counting again;</li>
            <li>If you begin to wander off into other thoughts, don’t judge yourself. Simply bring yourself back to the awareness of your breath</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's simpler than you thought, isn't it?</p>
        <p>What will really make you reap the benefits of meditation is the consistency and you don't have to meditate for 30 minutes every day. Start with 5, 10 minutes and
            gradually increase the time.</p>
        <h3>Remember to breathe</h3>
        <p>When we are going too fast - body and mind, this generates tension in the muscles and has negative
            impacts on the brain and heart as it impairs our circulation.
            Doing deep breathing cycles (inhale and exhale deeply and slowly), we oxygenate our
            brain, slow down our heartbeat and return to the present moment, which is where it all happens.
            It is in the present that we create the future based on our thoughts, feelings, emotions and vibration. We
            are like a radio that tunes to certain frequencies.</p>
        <h3>Where have you been tuning in?</h3>
        <h3>Where would you like to tune in from now on?</h3>
